An Unconference is an event for and driven by the participants. The audience actively participates in the unconference by proposing topics, holding presentations (if you like to) and by choosing which topics shall be presented. Only the most interesting ones are presented.

###How to organise an Unconference?

 * Collect contributions, which can be talks, workshops, discussion ideas or happenings
 * Collect interests, which can be everything and try to find speakers for these
 * Present the topics to the audience
 * Ask the audience to vote on them
 * According to the ranking of the topics arrange the speakers slots, so the topics with the highest votes will not be held parallel
 * Each topic should last 45 minutes, and in addition 15 minutes for discussions and questions
 * Plan in addition coffee-breaks for intense knowledge exchange and discussions beside the slots
 * These coffee-breaks are as important as the presentations
 * If there is a deeper interest in one topic, put it in on the proposal list for the next day / unconference
 * A short summary of each talk/topic is presented in the closing session and published to the wiki

###The different roles

The role of the attendees is to propose topics and to choose between them.

The role of the organisation team is to create a suitable setting with an open space, coffee, food and WiFi connection.

The role of the moderation team is to collect the proposed topics, to organise the voting and the arrangement of the speakers slots.


###Background
An [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) is based on [the Open Space Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology), which allows the moderations of events with a huge number of members.
