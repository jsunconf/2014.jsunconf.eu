The JS Unconf will start on Saturday, the 26th of April at 9AM in the
Geomatikum, Hamburg which is a three minute walk from the bus and subway
station "Schlump".

We will have four parallel tracks and each slot has 45 minutes.

If your talk gets voted, you can organize it as you wish, between
presentation, demo, disussion, Q&A, etc.

Between each slot there is a 15min break and we will have one big lunch
break each day.

There are still some tickets left on
