Your contributions, talks and discussions are the lifeblood of an Unconference.
We created a platform where you can collect your interests and proposals:
[Contribs & Interests](http://contribs.jsunconf.eu/)

Please check out [http://contribs.jsunconf.eu/](http://contribs.jsunconf.eu/)
and submit your interests.

If there are interests from other people and you want to give a talk about that
topic, please submit your contribution.

Everyone is invited to give a talk at JS Unconf: in the mornings of both days
every attendee will vote on the final amount of submitted talks - the talks
with the most votes will be put on the schedule then.

We are looking forward to many awesome sessions at the Unconference!
