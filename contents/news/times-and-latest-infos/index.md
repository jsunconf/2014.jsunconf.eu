The JS Unconf will start each day at 9AM. Saturday evening will be an event in the Grüner Jäger with free drinks. All locations are described in our [location section](http://2014.jsunconf.eu/location/).

After the breakfast which starts at 9AM we will vote together which talks we want to see during the day. Shortly after the voting we should have [http://schedule.jsunconf.eu/](http://schedule.jsunconf.eu/) updated.

We will have four parallel tracks and each slot has 45 minutes. You can organize your talk as you wish, between presentation, demo, disussion, Q&A, etc.

Speakers can add the links to their slides to our wiki: [https://github.com/jsunconf/2014.jsunconf.eu/wiki](https://github.com/jsunconf/2014.jsunconf.eu/wiki)

Between each slot there are breaks for drinking coffee and sharing experiences.

The Unconference ends on Sunday around 5PM.
