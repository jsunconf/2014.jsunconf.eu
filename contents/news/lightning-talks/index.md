JS Unconf wouldn't be JS Unconf without you! We asked on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsunconf) if we should introduce lightning talks and people were quite interested!
The goal is to showcase projects and topics which do not fit in 45 minutes. Speakers get exactly 2*Ï€ minutes (6.17min) to present their project or topic, without slides.

All lightning talks are scheduled in the last session on Sunday. We will have a whiteboard for proposals. Just write your name & topic on it during the Saturday or Sunday. The Slots are limited: First come, first serve!
