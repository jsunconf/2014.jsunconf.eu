We will have a small pre-party with free drinks together with the awesome
 folks of the [JavaScript Usergroup Hamburg (HH.js)](http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/)

It is a 15min walk from U/S Sternschanze.

**Important:** please RSVP at
[http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/events/151538672/](http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/events/151538672/) so the bar owner knows how much staff is needed and nobody has to wait for their drinks.
